# cypress-tests

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am sharing some of the Cypress tests that I have written in my previous QA Engineer position at Kiwi.com, to give you an idea of what my code looks like: 

Code includes
  - Intercepting requests and waiting for their aliases to check responses
  - Using if and else if conditions for conditional logic
  - Saving data retrieved from endpoints as constants for later use
  - Invokeing text from elements and verifying their content against expected values
  - Checks attributes such as href or other specific attributes of elements for expected conditions

**Cypress folder**
- each Cypress folder contains the cypressTest.cy.js file and the TestRailScenarios.md file

**Support folder**
- contains helper functions; such as intercept, filters, consts

Thank you for your time, I am looking forward to hearing from you.
